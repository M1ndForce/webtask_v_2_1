              Matthews, Maple Leafs defeat Jets in overtime to end losing streak
            </h2>
            TORONTO -- Auston Matthews scored 59 seconds into overtime and the
            Toronto Maple Leafs ended a three-game losing streak with a 4-3 win
            against the Winnipeg Jets at Scotiabank Arena on Thursday. Matthews
            took a pass from Morgan Rielly and shot over Connor Hellebuyck's
            glove for his NHL-leading 21st goal. "I just tried to sell shot and
            take it to the backhand and tried to find some open net," Matthews
            said.

            CALGARY -- The Calgary Flames won in Darryl Sutter's debut as coach,
            2-1 against the Montreal Canadiens at Scotiabank Saddledome on
            Thursday. Sutter, who replaced Geoff Ward on March 4, is in his
            second tenure with the Flames. He was 107-73-15 with 15 ties in
            three seasons as their coach from 2002-06, including advancing to
            the Stanley Cup Final in 2004, and was their general manager from
            2003-10. "Every win ... there's lots of them," Sutter said. "They're
            all the same. You take it and get ready for the next one."

              Take your pick: these are the top Leafs goalie masks of all time
            </h2>
            To mark the release of the Leafs' throwback Reverse Retro jersey,
            we're taking a trip down memory lane, detailing the Blue and White's
            most recognizable goalie helmets-from Johnny Bower's barely there
            bucket to Cujo's bloodthirsty hound paint and all the remarkable
            buckets in between.
